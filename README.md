# 📊 Task 5 – Data Analysis on CSV (Python Internship)

## 📌 Overview
This task includes basic data analysis using *Pandas* and data visualization with *Matplotlib*.  
I analyzed a sales dataset, calculated insights, and plotted graphs in a Jupyter Notebook.

## ✔ What I Did
- Loaded and cleaned the CSV file (sales.csv)
- Explored data using head(), info(), and describe()
- Calculated total sales
- Performed product-wise and month-wise sales analysis using groupby()
- Created bar and line charts using Matplotlib

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📁 Files Included
- *task5.ipynb* – Notebook with complete analysis  
- *sales.csv* – Sample dataset  
- *README.md* – Documentation  

## 📚 What I Learned
- Reading and cleaning datasets  
- Data summarization with Pandas  
- Plotting graphs using Matplotlib  
- Using Jupyter Notebook for analysis  

## ▶ How to Run
1. Install libraries:


pip install pandas matplotlib

2. Open task5.ipynb
3. Run each cell to view results and graphs

## ✅ Status
✔ Task 5 Completed
